# State Management Service

State Management Service - Provides a REST API for basic infrastructure technology state management.

## Description

This service is intended to aid testing of the GHGA Archive by providing a unified
API for managing state in infrastructure technologies such as MongoDB, S3, Apache Kafka,
and the Hashicorp Vault.

This service should **never** be deployed to production. It is *only* intended for use
in the Testing and Staging environments, where there is no access to real data.
Despite this, the services provides a way to restrict which databases and collections
can be accessed with this service through configuration, and a simple API key
(set in config) that can be used to authenticate requests.


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-build version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/state-management-service):
```bash
docker pull ghga/state-management-service:4.0.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/state-management-service:4.0.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/state-management-service:4.0.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
sms --help
```

## Configuration

### Usage:

A template YAML for configurating the service can be found at
[`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.sms.yaml`, and place it into one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory were you are execute the service (on unix: `./.sms.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on unix: `~/.sms.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `sms_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `sms_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To using file secrets please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.

## HTTP API
An OpenAPI specification for this service can be found [here](./openapi.yaml).

## Architecture and Design:
API calls to the State Management Service are authenticated through a configured API Key.

For each technology, REST API endpoints will be exposed, prefixed as follows:

| **Technology Name** | **Prefix**  |
|---------------------|-------------|
| MongoDB             | `/documents/`|
| Apache Kafka        | `/events/`  |
| S3                  | `/objects/` |
| Vault               | `/secrets/` |

Branch isolation is achieved in shared state technologies by the use of prefixes in,
for example, database names.
The `db_prefix` and `topic_prefix` config values are used so the prefixes must only be
specified once. They are applied to database and topic names automatically throughout
the SMS instance, establishing another means to restrict access.


## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a convenience commands `dev_install` is available.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
